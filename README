NAME
    Bundle::Text::SenseClusters Bundle to install SenseClusters and all of
    its dependent CPAN modules

SYNOPSIS
    To install SenseClusters and all dependent CPAN modules automatically,
    just run the following:

    "perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Text::SenseClusters'"

    To manually install this module type the following:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install 

DESCRIPTION
    This bundle includes the core SenseClusters distribution, as well as all
    required CPAN modules.

    In addition to this Bundle, you must also download and install two C
    packages, CLUTO and SVDPACKC, in order to install SenseClusters and make
    it fully operational. These are available in Text-SenseClusters in
    /External. There is a script called "install.sh" to help you install
    them.
