NAME
    Bundle::Text::SenseClusters - Bundle to install Text::SenseClusters and
    all of its dependent CPAN modules.

SYNOPSIS
    To install Text::SenseClusters and all dependent CPAN modules
    automatically, just run the following:

     C<perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Text::SenseClusters'>

    To manually install this module type the following:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install 

DESCRIPTION
    This bundle includes the core SenseClusters distribution, as well as all
    required CPAN modules. The core SenseClusters distribution consists of
    numerous Perl programs (found in the /Toolkit directory), plus SVDPACKC,
    a 3rd party C package that performs Singular Value Decomposition.

    In addition to this Bundle, you must also download and install the
    clustering toolkit Cluto, in order to make SenseClusters operational.
    There is a script called "install.sh" in SenseClusters /External
    directory that will automatically download and install Cluto, and it
    will also compile and install SVDPACKC.

    Thus, you should be able to install SenseClusters by simply installing
    this Bundle and then going to SenseClusters/External directory and
    running the "install.sh" script.
